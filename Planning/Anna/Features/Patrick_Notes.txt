Possible things I KNOW I can add:

//All branched under one big task
Save game- might be complicated but can do
Multiple games at one time?
Load game

//Tools and such
Finding plants and recording them
-Store plants/naming them
-Using special tools for poisonous plants

//Will put in after base game, want to focus on the core then move to the survival part
Dying and player needs

Customize character- doable with PlayerSkin(head, body, shoes, gender, skinColor);
Use Reference class to get values for each (texture paths for clothing, vec3 color, stuff like that)

put those things here:
